# Wi-Fi Hacking Scripts Collection

Welcome to the Wi-Fi Hacking Scripts Collection!

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and utilities for Wi-Fi network penetration testing and security analysis. Leveraging tools such as tshark, scrapy, and various Python libraries, these scripts provide a comprehensive toolkit for conducting Wi-Fi hacking and security assessments.

## Features
- Automated Wi-Fi network discovery and reconnaissance.
- Packet sniffing and analysis using tshark for capturing and inspecting network traffic.
- Web scraping and data extraction with scrapy for gathering information from Wi-Fi routers and access points.
- Customizable scripts for performing specific Wi-Fi hacking techniques, such as deauthentication attacks, rogue access point creation, and more.


## Usage
- **Packet Sniffing**: Use tshark-based scripts to capture and analyze Wi-Fi traffic. Adjust filters and parameters as needed for specific network analysis tasks.
- **Web Scraping**: Utilize scrapy-based scripts to scrape data from Wi-Fi routers and access points. Customize spiders and XPath expressions to extract relevant information.
- **Custom Scripts**: Explore and run custom Python scripts for performing various Wi-Fi hacking techniques. Refer to script documentation and comments for usage instructions and options.

## Security and Ethics
- Use these scripts responsibly and ethically for authorized penetration testing and security research purposes only.
- Respect applicable laws and regulations governing Wi-Fi network security and privacy.
- Avoid using these tools for illegal or malicious activities, including unauthorized access to networks or devices.
